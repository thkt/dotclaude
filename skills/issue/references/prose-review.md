# Prose Review

Write for a teammate who shares context and can open the linked docs. The issue carries the delta; links carry the background. Do not write a line whose removal would not mislead the reader. Lexical empty phrasing is out of scope here and checked separately via the phrases files.

## Structure

| Check          | Question                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem stated | Is the problem or request in 1-3 lines at the top?                                                                      |
| Concreteness   | Bug: are reproduction steps concrete? Feature: is the use case concrete? Is the expected outcome not left to inference? |
| Delta focus    | Does it skip what the code shows and stay on why and done conditions?                                                   |
| Length         | Does the body fit in ~40 lines? If it overflows, cut it or split into another issue / link                              |

## Redundancy patterns

| Pattern                | Fix                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Doc transcription      | Fold restated linked docs or logs into link + one-line takeaway; write only the delta                                                 |
| Repeated decision      | State the same design reason once, where the decision lands. Option comparisons stay out of the body and belong to think                   |
| Over-specified AC      | Keep the criterion, drop authoring details such as story names and enumerated config values                                                    |
| One claim per sentence | Cut a sentence exceeding ~25 words (Japanese: 60 characters), or a paragraph packing decision + rationale + references, at each claim |
