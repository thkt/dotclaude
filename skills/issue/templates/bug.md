# Bug Template

When /issue classifies the request as bug, it generates the title and body from this skeleton.

## Template

`{...}` is replaced with content at generation. Sections marked `(optional)` are omitted, heading and all, when there is nothing to say. Fixed items (the reproduction, expected/actual) stay unmarked; tentative items (a suspected cause, an inferred fix direction) carry a `(tentative: <action at pickup>)` mark (§ Confidence Marking).

## Scope

- Out of scope: {Related but not addressed here}

## Constraints (optional)

## Premises (optional)

## Environment (optional)
