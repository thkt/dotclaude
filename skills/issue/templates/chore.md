# Chore Template

When /issue classifies the request as chore, it generates the title and body from this skeleton.

## Template

`{...}` is replaced with content at generation. Sections marked `(optional)` are omitted, heading and all, when there is nothing to say.

```markdown
## What & Why

## Changes

- {Specific change 1}
- {Specific change 2}

## Scope

- In scope: {What this issue covers}
- Out of scope: {Related cleanup not addressed here}

## Constraints (optional)

```

## Guidelines

| Field       | OK                                                  | NG                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| What & Why  | "Upgrade React 18→19, unblocks concurrent features" | "Upgrade React" (no Why)        |
| Changes     | "Update package.json, fix breaking API calls"       | "Update dependencies" (vague)   |
| Scope       | "Only React core, not React Router"                 | (omitted)                       |
| Constraints | "No behavior changes to existing components"        | (omitted when scope is unclear) |
