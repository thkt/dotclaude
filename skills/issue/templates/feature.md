# Feature Template

When /issue classifies the request as feature, it generates the title and body from this skeleton.

## Template

`{...}` is replaced with content at generation. Sections marked `(optional)` are omitted, heading and all, when there is nothing to say. Fixed items (the ask, AC, decided constraints) stay unmarked; tentative items (AI-inferred HOW, an open decision) carry a `(tentative: <action at pickup>)` mark (criteria in SKILL.md § Confidence marking).

```markdown
## What & Why

{What to build - 1-2 sentences}
{Why it's needed - user problem or business reason}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {When X, then Y happens}
- [ ] {When X, then Y happens}

## Scope

- In scope: {What this issue covers}
- Out of scope: {What this issue explicitly excludes}

## Accessibility (optional)

- {UI-touching issues only. Expected input modes and the criteria to meet: "all operations complete with keyboard only" / "errors are announced to screen readers via aria-live"}
- {Why the chosen direction (optional): "use native <dialog>; focus management comes standard (tentative: decide at pickup)"}

## Approach (optional)

- {Tentative implementation direction, a starting point rather than a fixed requirement: "place under OrderService to match existing structure (tentative: decide at pickup)"}

## Constraints (optional)

- {Technical constraints, prohibited approaches, dependencies}

## Premises (optional)

- {Unverified assumption the work depends on, with a recheck marker: "Design ref: <link>. Confirm latest before starting" / "Target files are candidates as of writing; recheck on pickup"}

## Testing Decisions

- {Definition of "good" for this issue: external behavior only, not implementation details}
- {Modules under test: which module/component/function gets tested}
- {Prior art: link or filename for the most similar existing test}
- {Skip rationale (optional): if no test is added, state why explicitly}
```

## Guidelines

| Field               | OK                                                   | NG                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| What & Why          | Add CSV export so users can analyze offline          | Add CSV export (no Why)                                  |
| Acceptance Criteria | When user clicks Export, a .csv downloads            | CSV export works correctly                               |
| Scope - Out of      | Excel format is out of scope                         | (omitted)                                                |
| Accessibility       | All operations complete with keyboard only           | Omitted despite UI changes, or bare "make it accessible" |
| Approach            | match OrderService structure; decide at pickup       | Inferred HOW stated as a fixed requirement               |
| Constraints         | Must not add new dependencies                        | (omitted when there are known constraints)               |
| Premises            | Figma node 9-2191; confirm latest before starting    | Unverified design stated as fact                         |
| Testing Decisions   | Test the CSV serializer; mirror tests/orders.test.ts | TBD or skipped without rationale                         |
