# use-cli-codegraph

## Commands

Run `codegraph <subcommand> --help` for options, output format, and exit codes. The help output is the authoritative source for the installed version.

| Purpose                            | Command                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Change impact (what breaks)        | `codegraph impact <symbol>`     |
| Callers                            | `codegraph callers <symbol>`    |
| Callees                            | `codegraph callees <symbol>`    |
| Symbol source + call trail         | `codegraph node <name>`         |
| Explore area (source + call paths) | `codegraph explore <query...>`  |
| Symbol search                      | `codegraph query <search>`      |
| Tests affected by changes          | `codegraph affected [files...]` |
| Index status                       | `codegraph status`              |

## When to Use

Structural queries only. Route symbol-level structure questions like who calls X or what breaks to codegraph, and keep free-text content search on Grep / Explore.

| Question                                | Tool                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| What breaks if I change X / who calls X | codegraph; Grep cannot trace structure     |
| Symbol definition + caller/callee trail | codegraph node / explore                   |
| Tests affected by changed files         | codegraph affected                         |
| Free-text or string content search      | Grep / Explore; codegraph is symbol-level  |
| Repo without a `.codegraph` index       | Grep / Explore, or prompt to init          |

## Prerequisite

| Item      | Detail                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| index     | `.codegraph/` required. Run `codegraph init` once per repo. If absent, ask whether to init and stop. Do not create it silently        |
| freshness | `codegraph status` shows up to date. Run `codegraph sync` after large changes. The watcher daemon keeps it current when running       |
| binary    | bun global (`~/.config/bun/bin/codegraph`). On EPERM during install / upgrade, prefix `npm_config_cache=$TMPDIR/cg` to work around it |
