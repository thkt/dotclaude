# /think - Design Exploration

Subject 2+ approaches to `critic-design` critique, and let only the surviving approach reach the structured plan. Write the plan to a draft file following the templates/plan.md skeleton and also return it in conversation. Persistence happens when `/issue` transfers it into the issue's Plan section.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` carries the task description and research context. If empty, confirm with the user via AskUserQuestion. The first line is the task title.

## Phase 1: Establish the Why

Read `.claude/OUTCOME.md`. If it does not exist, generate it via `/outcome`. The Why is three things, plus a fourth when the task is a Bug: who is having trouble and with what, what counts as success, why now, and for a Bug what the root cause is. Attach evidence to the trouble. Identify the root cause together with evidence such as reproduction steps or logs; when the cause is undetermined, do not proceed to design and route to `/research` instead. When the report that comes back carries a `Hypotheses Log` section, read it as the evidence for the cause. Design starts only once this Why is readable from $ARGUMENTS and the conversation. Do not proceed on placeholders; pin it down via AskUserQuestion.

## Phase 2: Design Exploration

Ground the approaches in the real code and existing research before making them. Steps 1 through 4 finish with no approach yet in existence.

1. Read the relevant code. When the task, the issue, or a research report cites a mock image or screenshot, open that image file with Read as well. Absence from the text is not evidence the element does not exist
2. Derive a lowercase hyphenated slug from the task's words and run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../research/scripts/find-prior-research.ts <slug> .claude/workspace/research. Read the matching report from the candidates on stdout, and take each of its parts per the table in ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/research-report-intake.md. With no candidate, proceed as though no research report exists
3. Search for the reference_module candidate: an existing module whose set of screens or layers matches the one being planned, in any domain. Pick the closest one and note the names of the others. Record the result as kind (module/no-module/new-shape) with a reason, and when none matches, note why this shape is new
4. Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../scribe/scripts/find_wiki_rule.py docs/wiki <slug> <the paths likely touched> --scene plan` and read the `matched` pages and `scenes` pages. A rule bears on how units are cut and which files they take, so reading it after the decomposition means cutting them again
5. Generate 2+ approaches from distinct perspectives (simplest thing that works / structure and extensibility / developer experience). Do not bundle independent technical decisions into one question; ask each separately with a recommendation and trade-offs
6. Launch `critic-design` on the approaches. Include the task title verbatim in the prompt, and have it return a single JSON object `{ verdict: "GO" | "NO-GO", weaknesses: string[], actionable: string[] }`
7. On NO-GO, resolve blockers inline before proceeding. Present the surviving design to the user with trade-off rationale, and wait for approval
8. After approval, ask whether the technical decision needs a DR

## Phase 3: Plan Generation

Decompose the approved design into units in implementation order. A unit is one independently implementable outcome. Serialize the result into PLAN_SCHEMA-equivalent JSON.

`{ test_command, reference_module, units: [{ id, goal, contract, files: string[], tests: [{ id, name }], seam }] }`

Decompose tests-first. Enumerate acceptance-test candidates from the whole design and group them per outcome. Each group becomes a unit, and its size follows from that test count.

1. Record reference_module by copying over what Phase 2's step 3 noted (§ reference_module)
2. Settle test_command (§ test_command)
3. Settle each unit's goal and files, and write its contract (§ contract)
4. Write each unit's preconditions (§ preconditions)
5. Assign the ids. The shape and the target repo's convention live in ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/id-numbering.md
6. tests[].name is a one-line condition + expected-result statement. That sentence becomes the test name as written, so never reword it later
7. A unit with no verifiable behavior (docs / config) gets an empty tests array
8. Route acceptance-test candidates that test_command cannot execute (a visual check, manual coordination with an external service) out of T-NNN and into `### Manual verification`. Each routed criterion names the mechanism that takes it on (test-storybook, code review, and so on)
9. A unit that renders domain fields lists each rendered field as its own T-NNN entry, one field per line; bundling them into one entry hides a single field's omission
10. A unit that carries tests lists in `files` every module those tests exercise, including one no file creates yet. The Red step may scaffold a module it is allowed to touch, and only a module in `files` is allowed. A unit whose tests import something outside its `files` fails Red with a module-resolution error, which names no planned scenario and so is not Red evidence: build skips the implementation and moves on.
11. A non-seam unit's caps are 3 files and 4 tests. A seam unit's tests cross the unit boundary, so its file count legitimately grows and the caps do not apply to it. Split any unit over the caps along outcomes, and confirm the resulting new unit composition with the user. Candidates carved out of scope stay out of the plan and go to backlog candidates. `UNIT_CAPS` in `workflows/build.js` owns these numbers. Change this description and `UNIT_CAPS` in the same commit
12. Once 2 or more units carry tests, place exactly one seam unit last and mark it `seam: true`. Every unit can be green while nothing has run the wiring that connects them. The seam unit's tests run the real modules across the unit boundary and assert that connection. Only I/O with external systems may be faked there
13. A seam unit's files include at least one non-test file: the one that makes the connection. Make the unit carrying it the seam, and order it last per step 12. When no unit carries a non-test file, re-cut the units per step 11 until one does
14. Once the units are settled, run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../scribe/scripts/find_wiki_rule.py docs/wiki <slug> <the units[].files> --scene plan` and diff it against what Phase 2 read. Every page under `matched` is either cited or written off in the prose with the reason it does not bear on this plan. A page under `related` only shares a word, so state why it bears when citing one. Every page under `scenes` is read
15. Pass the self-check (missing required fields, duplicate ids, empty units / files / goal / contract) and the pre-writeout verification in ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/pre-write-check.md, then write the plan following the ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/plan.md skeleton to `.claude/workspace/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.plan.md`. The slug is the lowercase hyphenated title. Include both the `## Plan` and `## Backlog candidates` sections

### test_command

A test_command failure must be attributable to the planned scope alone. On a repository carrying pre-existing debt such as repo-wide type errors or format drift, scope the gate by paths: lint the touched directories and filter type-check output by path patterns, never by content grep. Write a command that works from the repository root.

Build's Red gate seals one complete output line of the failing run and re-runs the command against it, so a line that changes between two runs of the same failure cannot serve as that anchor. `node --test`'s default reporter prints a per-run duration on every line; `--test-reporter=tap` prints `not ok N - <name>` and does not. Pick the reporter or formatter that leaves the failure line byte-identical across runs.

### reference_module

A contract can cite a behavior at one call site only, so the implementer hand-rolls the surrounding structure. Record what Phase 2's step 3 noted as `reference_module: { kind, reason, path, files, instances, conventions }` without searching again. kind is one of module/no-module/new-shape; a kind other than module requires a reason. The structure goes in the plan's reference module section, and every unit refers to it.

1. Make U-001 its structure replication (same directory layout, component names, export names; tests is an empty array) only when the skeleton fits under 4 files. Otherwise split units by layer and let each unit replicate its own slice
2. State the shared conventions to keep (which shared components it composes, where formatting is written, how state is passed). Deviating is allowed only with a stated reason in the plan
3. Name the candidates not picked in the prose, along with why kind is not module. A kind with no reason is a planning defect
4. When instances is 2 or more, say "Nth instance" in the prose, telling the implementer to replicate rather than design

### preconditions

List existing dependencies only, each line repo-root-relative in one of two forms: path only, or path + stable anchor. An anchor is limited to a single exported / public symbol name that `ugrep -F` matches as a literal fixed string; never private implementation details, comment strings, or line numbers. When no stable symbol exists, write the line as path only. Files newly created by a unit are never listed.

### contract

Select, do not generate. Never sketch behavior in prose or invent new code fragments; a contract is a citation plus one intent line.

A rule bearing across units goes in `### Rules`, not in a contract. For a new shape with no citable source, do not invent a signature: leave the shape to implementation and let the acceptance tests pin the behavior. When a mock or design document carries UI wording verbatim (labels, placeholders, button text, option names), copy it in with the source path attached.

Look for the source down the table below and take the first that answers. External libraries follow SOURCING.md.

| Source                                         | How it is copied                                                                                                                                                                    |
