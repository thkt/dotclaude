# DR Gaps Audit Report Template

The skeleton that `/census` Phase 6 emits. Repeat the Source File Decisions `###` section per source file and the Prose Document Decisions `###` section per document. Batch source files with no decisions into one trailing line. Record a document with no decisions as `no decisions found` under its `###`.

## Template

Substitute `{...}` from findings. For enum cells, pick the matching value from the `/`-separated choices. The three DR Promotion Candidates rows show the challenge-verdict to Final mapping: keep is DR, downgrade is inline-comment, drop is skip. Write the one matching row per candidate.
