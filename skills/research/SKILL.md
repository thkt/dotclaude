# /research - Project & Technical Investigation

Investigate the codebase and record findings with sources, without implementation.

## Input

The research subject is taken from `$ARGUMENTS`, a free-text topic or question. If empty, prompt via AskUserQuestion.

## Phase 1: Outcome Anchor

Read `.claude/OUTCOME.md`. If absent, generate the stub via /outcome. If the investigation steps into Non-goals, confirm with the user before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Prior Research Scan

Derive the lowercase hyphenated subject slug from `$ARGUMENTS` and search prior research with `bfs .claude/workspace/research -name '*<slug>*.md'`. If no match, note "No prior research found for `<slug>`" and move on. For each match, carry forward per the table below.

| Extract                 | Carry to | Handling                           |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Key Findings table      | Phase 7  | Re-verify or supersede as baseline |
| Constraints table       | Phase 4  | Use as input, do not re-discover   |
| Disconfirmation results | Phase 7  | Reference                          |

## Phase 3: Intent and Domain Clarification

Skip if `$ARGUMENTS` clearly indicates both. Otherwise ask via AskUserQuestion, with intent chosen from Feature planning / Bug investigation / Understanding and Domain from Data model / API / Infrastructure / General. Domain drives Phase 4 scoping, and General applies no scoping.

## Phase 4: Domain-Scoped Parallel Investigation

Launch Explore / ugrep / bfs / Read in parallel. State the source for each finding in place. Facts are `file:line`, inferences `inferred from X`, unverified `unknown, requires X`. Append each command and its raw output verbatim to the scratch. This is the audit trail; Phase 7 Disconfirmation quotes it directly and does not reconstruct.

For Feature planning or Bug investigation intent, also invoke `Task(subagent_type: explorer-feature, run_in_background: false)` to trace execution paths. Feature planning traces the prospective path, Bug investigation the failing path. Include the research subject title verbatim in the spawn prompt, and have it return a single JSON object `{ findings: [{ statement: string, source: string }] }`. If it returns empty, re-run with broader keywords.

When the repo has a `.codegraph/` index, refresh it with `codegraph sync` and resolve structural questions such as who calls, what breaks, and which tests are affected with codegraph first. Get callers with `codegraph callers <symbol>` and the blast radius plus affected tests with `codegraph impact <symbol>`, and cite that output as the finding's source. A ugrep / grep search for the symbol name is not accepted as a source for the same questions. In a repo without the index, do not init unprompted; fall back to Explore / ugrep, and use ugrep / grep only for free-text content search.

Scope by Domain per the table below. Pass the roots to Explore in its prompt, append the terms to ugrep / bfs, and start Read from the roots. If the target Domain's glob roots are all missing, fall back to General.

| Domain         | Glob roots                                                      | Domain-aligned terms            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Data model     | `schema/`, `models/`, `db/`, `drizzle/`, `prisma/`, `*.sql`     | model, migration, table, column |
| API            | `routes/`, `handlers/`, `controllers/`, `api/`, `server/`       | endpoint, route, handler        |
| Infrastructure | `terraform/`, `infra/`, `ci/`, `.github/`, `deploy/`, `docker/` | pipeline, deploy, provision     |
| General        | No scoping. Let Explore find                                    | none                            |

### Verification

At the close, apply the checks in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/verification.md`. Use Cross-method verification for exhaustiveness findings and primary-source verification for external-behavior claims, structurally, with no self-judged exclusion of a finding. Verifying library API behavior applies `~/.claude/rules/development/SOURCING.md`, and when scout is unavailable (missing / network fails), fall back to WebFetch / WebSearch.

## Phase 5: Strong Inference (Bug investigation only)

Apply `~/.claude/rules/core/OPERATION.md § Debug Investigation Protocol` to eliminate the bug, then once the root cause is confirmed, run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/verification.md § Same-origin sweep`.

## Phase 6: Advisor Pre-Synthesis Check

Invoke `advisor()` with no parameters. Advisor sees the full conversation history. If it flags a missed area or weak inference, return to Phase 4 to narrow the scoping.

Skip the invocation only when all conditions hold, and record the skip reason in the output.

- Phase 2 hit prior research and the current run inherits only
- Intent is Understanding and Domain is General
- No claim crosses a repository boundary or drives PR scope

## Phase 7: Synthesis

1. If Phase 2 found prior research, integrate the inherited findings / constraints into Key Findings, marking each re-verified or superseded
2. Confirm each finding carries a source in the Phase 4 format. Back facts with `file:line` or command output; mark gaps `unknown, requires X`
3. Record Disconfirmation. If Phase 5 ran, write `Covered by Phase 5 elimination`; if skipped, quote the command and raw output from the scratch verbatim. Treat 0 hits as possible tool misuse before absence
4. Confirm every Phase 3 question is answered or recorded as `unknown, requires X`

## Output

Generate the report following the skeleton in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/research.md`, fill in `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`, and save to `.claude/workspace/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.

## Completion Criteria

Not done until all are satisfied. An item whose Condition carries "(...)" is required only when applicable.
