# MADR: Markdown Architectural Decision Records

MADR is a streamlined markdown template for recording decisions, one file per decision. This file assumes v4. The A expanded to Any in 2022 and back to Architectural in 2024, yet upstream allowed recording any decision throughout; what moved was the focus. This skill steps off the wobbling name by saying DR, covering decisions beyond architecture.

## Required Sections

Confirmation is optional in upstream MADR v4 but treated as required by this skill.

| Section                       | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Title                         | `# {title}`. Short declarative statement      |
| Context and Problem Statement | Why the decision is being made                |
| Considered Options            | Alternatives examined as a bullet list        |
| Decision Outcome              | Chosen option and the immediate justification |
| Confirmation (under Outcome)  | How to verify implementation matches decision |

## Recommended Sections

These go under More Information as an h3. A DR without a More Information section may carry one as a standalone h2, and validate-dr.ts accepts either level. A missing one returns a warning rather than an error.

| Section               | Purpose                                                                                                  |
