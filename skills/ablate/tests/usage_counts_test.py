"""Tests for skills/ablate/scripts/usage_counts.py.

Run: python3 skills/ablate/tests/usage_counts_test.py

Fixture records follow the shape a real ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl transcript carries for
a hook fire (confirmed by reading a live transcript in this session): a top-level "timestamp"
paired with an "attachment" object whose "hookEvent" is PreToolUse or PostToolUse and whose
"command" names the hook script that fired. A real "command" carries the home-relative form
the harness invoked ("~/.claude/hooks/pre-bash/wiki_scene.ts"), measured over this session's
transcripts, so the fixtures below write that form rather than the repo-root-relative path a
harness element is named by.
