Reads every session transcript under the transcripts root the caller passes (the running
side's `projects/` directory) and counts, per harness element, how many PreToolUse/PostToolUse
hook fires named it and the most recent date one did.

The measurement window and the rare-by-design set live here as script constants, never as
