# /ablate measurement criteria

Used by Phase 2 to build each element's observation and by `verdict.classify` in
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/verdict.ts` to score it. The run count, pass threshold, and arm
list stay script constants in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/arms.ts`; a copy of a number here
goes stale on the next edit to that file with nothing to catch it
(`docs/wiki/deterministic-script-judgment.md`).

## Why a fixed task set

A rule that never fires during a run leaves nothing to compare between arms:
`verdict.classify` returns `unmeasured` whenever an element's own triggering task is absent
from the run's task set, before it looks at compliance at all. Phase 2 draws every
`trigger_task` from the table below instead of inventing one per run, so two ablation runs
measuring the same rule start from the same task and stay comparable.

## Rule to triggering task

`always-loaded` carries no path or glob condition of its own, so the task below is the only
thing that makes a run exercise it. `path-triggered` already names its own condition in its
`paths:` frontmatter; the task below names one concrete file shape that condition matches.

## What `complies` means

`complies` in each observation records whether the wiped arm's transcript already honors the
triggering task's own rule, judged by reading that arm's output against the specific
directive the task exercises. `verdict.classify` turns it into a verdict; this file does not
restate that mapping.

A violation never reads as keep on its own. `arms.PASS_THRESHOLD` decides only how many of
`arms.RUN_COUNT` runs must agree before `complies` is set at all, so a human still confirms
the violation traces to the removed element rather than to run noise.
