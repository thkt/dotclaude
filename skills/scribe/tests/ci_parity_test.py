"""Parity tests between .github/workflows/scribe.yml and its two contracts.

The tool set scribe.yml grants the claude step has to track skills/scribe/SKILL.md's
allowed-tools line (skill_contract_test.py already pins that line's shape), or a tool the
skill can call goes missing in CI while local /scribe keeps working. The trigger, gate, and
failure-report shapes come from issue #531's Plan for U-004; there is no prior file to read
them off, so this test is the only thing pinning them once scribe.yml exists.

Run: python3 skills/scribe/tests/ci_parity_test.py
