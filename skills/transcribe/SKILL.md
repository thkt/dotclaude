# /transcribe - Spreadsheet Reader

The Read tool cannot open an xlsx. Use hucre, installed in this repository, as a library to read the sheets.

## Steps

1. Look at the shape of the contents.

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cli.ts list <xlsx>
```

The sheet list and the fill ratio come out. The fill ratio is the share of cells holding a value, and it decides the next branch.

2. Decide how to read from the fill ratio.

| Fill ratio  | State                                                 | How to read                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Under 20%   | Merges and layout-only empty cells take up most of it | Convert with extract, then read                                |
| 20% or more | Close to one record per row                           | Narrow to the sheet with `--sheet` and extract it on `generic` |

3. Convert. Write the output outside the repository, or wherever the user asked for.

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cli.ts extract <xlsx> --out <dir> [--profile <name>] [--sheet <n|name>]
```

4. Check that nothing was lost. Do not skip this check. A wrong layout judgment deletes cells without raising an error, so reconciliation is the only thing that reveals it.

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cli.ts verify <xlsx> <dir>
```

`OK: every cell of N sheets survived into the output.` means done. On a loss it returns the sheet name and the first 40 characters of a lost cell, so fix the profile's judgment and run it again.

## Profiles

Layout-specific judgment lives in a profile. The definitions are in `profiles` in `scripts/convert.ts`.

Reach for `generic` first on an unknown layout. Add a profile only when you want tables restored. A profile carries five judgments, and a judgment set to null is not performed.

| Profile             | Target                                                            | Behavior                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generic` (default) | A file whose layout is unknown                                    | Reads nothing as a table. Only folds merged cells, so no information is lost |
| `ja-api-spec`       | A Japanese API design document with 項番 and パラメータ名 columns | Restores headings, parameter tables, two-tier headers and code blocks        |

| Key                  | Judgment                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docHeaderFirstCell` | When A1 holds this string, fold the first 3 rows as document information                                 |
| `heading`            | Make a 1-2 cell row matching this regex a heading                                                        |
| `tableHeadWords`     | Make a row matching this regex with 3 or more cells a table header                                       |
| `nestColumnLabel`    | In a column whose label contains this word, restore the cell position within the column as nesting depth |
| `code`               | Join single-cell rows matching this regex into a code block                                              |

## What decides the approach

For a single question, point `extract --sheet <n|name> --out` at a temp directory, read from there, and leave nothing in the repository. Keep Markdown files only for repeated cross-file greps, for a human reader, or for tracking diffs in git.

The fill ratio decides what conversion buys. The lower it runs, the more the empty cells spend in tokens, and the more conversion takes off.

## Dependency

`hucre` is installed at the repository root (`bun add hucre`). Where it is absent, the script prints the install step and exits. node walks up from the script to find `node_modules`, so installing it in `~/.claude` resolves a plugin install.

It stays on JavaScript because `hucre` carries xlsx, ods and csv in one package. openpyxl does not read ods and would need odfpy alongside it, and every Python script in this repository is standard-library only with no dependency manifest. A standard-library rewrite takes on the part where a date cell is a bare number and only `numFmtId` in `styles.xml` tells you it is a date.

Do not use the CLI (`hucre convert`). Three reasons.

| Reason                       | Evidence                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It drops merged cells        | The CLI's own description says `cell values only — styles, merges, formulas`       |
| It drops every sheet but one | On a 3-sheet file it prints `Read 3 sheet(s)` and writes one sheet                 |
| It cannot emit Markdown      | `convert <INPUT> <OUTPUT>` converts formats only, with no option to select a sheet |
