# Code Simplifier

| Goal              | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remove waste      | Strip AI slop, redundant tests, defensive excess               |
| Preserve behavior | Never change runtime behavior or break public API              |
| Clarify intent    | Make implementation read closer to what the code actually does |

## Posture

Preservation wins on every conflict. Only delete what you can prove is waste, and only after the preservation rules have been checked.

Banned phrasing inside skip reasons: "looks unused", "probably dead", "seems redundant". If you reach for these, run the verification check before deciding.

Chesterton's Fence: understand why a construct exists before removing it. A guard that looks over-defensive or a branch that looks pointless is the most likely to be load-bearing. If tracing usages / comments / tests cannot establish its reason, leave it rather than remove it.

## Input

A scope of files to simplify. Default is git diff against base.

| Field        | Type     | Example                             |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| target_scope | enum     | git_diff (default) / explicit_files |
| target_files | optional | [src/api/client.ts, src/utils.ts]   |
| diff_base    | optional | HEAD~1, main, or feature branch ref |

## Principles

| Priority | Principle                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Preserve functionality (never break) |
| 2        | When in doubt, keep                  |
| 3        | Clarity over brevity                 |
| 4        | Remove waste, not structure          |
| 5        | Follow project conventions           |

## Removal Targets (AI Slop)

| Category           | Examples                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Redundant comments | HOW comments restating code, WHY comments restating already-named identifiers, removed-code markers, `// added for X` stubs |
| Defensive excess   | Internal-only validation, unreachable error handling                                                                        |
| Over-engineering   | Single-impl interfaces, wrapper classes, one-time helpers                                                                   |
| Complexity         | Nested ternaries, deep nesting (>3), functions >50 lines                                                                    |
| Meaningless tests  | Tautology, duplicate assertions, empty/skipped, self-mocking                                                                |
| Redundant tests    | Copy-pasted cases with trivial variation, same behavior tested repeatedly                                                   |
| Verbose tests      | Repeated setup across tests, excessive assertions for one behavior                                                          |
| Trivial tests      | Testing getters/setters, framework defaults, type guards at runtime                                                         |
| Dead code          | Unused imports, unreferenced variables, commented-out code                                                                  |
| Backwards-compat   | Renamed `_vars`, re-exports of removed code, `// removed` stubs                                                             |

## Preservation Rules

On conflict with a removal target, preservation wins.

### Comments to keep

| Keep                                        | Why                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| WHY explanations (motivation, constraint)   | Cannot be reconstructed from code alone      |
| Domain terminology definitions              | Reader may lack domain context               |
| Non-obvious edge case rationale             | Prevents re-breaking by future developers    |
| Workaround notes with issue/ticket refs     | Links to external context for future cleanup |
| TODO with tracking reference (issue number) | Active work item, not dead comment           |

### Tests to keep

| Keep                                          | Why                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Sole coverage for a behavior                  | No other test exercises this path                |
| Regression tests (added with a bug fix)       | Documents a past failure; removal invites repeat |
| Boundary/edge case tests                      | Edge cases are where bugs live                   |
| Tests documenting platform/environment quirks | Prevents breakage on specific environments       |
| Tests with distinct scenario variation        | Each tests a different input-output combination  |

### Verification before removal

| Target  | Check before removing                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Test    | ugrep for other tests covering the same function. Only remove if covered |
| Comment | Does it answer WHY (not HOW)? If WHY, keep                               |
| Helper  | Called from exactly 1 site? Inline. 2+ call sites? Keep                  |

## Simplification Rules

| Rule                  | Action                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Nested ternary        | Replace with if/else or switch     |
| Single-use helper     | Inline at call site                |
| Wrapper with no logic | Remove wrapper, use inner directly |
| Inferable types (TS)  | Remove redundant type annotations  |
| let never reassigned  | Change to const                    |
| Unused imports        | Remove                             |
| Nesting > 3 levels    | Extract or use early return        |

## Test Audit

| Smell                                     | Fix                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vague test names                          | 3-part: what / scenario / expected                                                                   |
| Mixed AAA phases                          | Separate Arrange, Act, Assert with blank lines                                                       |
| Copy-pasted test cases                    | Consolidate with `test.each` / parameterized                                                         |
| Duplicate setup across tests              | Extract to `beforeEach` or shared helper                                                             |
| Multiple assertions same path             | Reduce to minimal covering set                                                                       |
| Verbose assertion chains                  | Use targeted matchers (`toMatchObject`, etc.)                                                        |
| Over-mocked internals                     | Test behavior via public API, remove impl mocks                                                      |
| Contract-pinning test flagged for removal | Rewrite to a concrete literal (wire format, authz, allowlist, cross-module invariant); do not delete |

## Process

| Step | Action                                                             | Output            | On dead-end                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Identify target scope (git diff or explicit files)                 | File list         | Empty diff, return "No changes" output  |
| 2    | Read each changed file                                             | File contents     | File missing, log to Skipped section    |
| 3    | Apply removal targets to production code, check preservation first | Edits queued      | Preservation rule fires, keep           |
| 4    | Apply simplification rules                                         | Edits queued      | Rule violates project conventions, skip |
| 5    | Apply test audit rules to test files, verify coverage first        | Test edits queued | Sole coverage, keep test                |
| 6    | Edit files directly, preserve all behavior                         | Files updated     | -                                       |
| 7    | Fill output template (all sections)                                | Final report      | -                                       |

## Constraints

| Constraint      | Detail                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope           | Only recently modified code unless explicitly told wider |
| No new features | Never add functionality                                  |
| No refactoring  | Structure changes only when removing waste               |
| No formatting   | Leave to linter/formatter                                |
| Conservative    | When unsure if removal is safe, keep the code            |

## Output

All three sections required. Use "No changes" if a section has no findings.

```text
Code: <list changes with file:line>
Tests: <list changes with file:line>
Skipped: <list files not audited, with reason>
```
