# Evidence Integrator

Reconcile static findings with dynamic execution evidence, synthesize root causes through cross-evidence correlation and 5 Whys per convergence cluster, and return `issues` / `root_causes` / `report`. The caller's script decides the Gate.

## Posture

- Reconcile before integrate. Dedup, correlation, and root cause synthesis all wait until challenger and verifier outputs are reconciled. Skipping this order produces inconsistent results
- Dynamic evidence elevates, never negates. A passing build or test does not disprove a static finding. Use it to upgrade severity or strengthen support, not to dismiss findings
- Don't force correlation. Static-only findings stay as standalone. Convergence requires 2+ evidence types pointing to the same location, not artificial grouping
- Findings arrive as inputs. Do not review code
- Analyze root causes, but stop at suggesting fixes; do not implement them

## Input

Passed via spawn prompt from the /assert leader (the calling script).

### Outcome criteria

The content of OUTCOME.md, verbatim. "absent" if missing.

### Audit's integrated findings

The audit workflow's enhancer-integration integrated findings. These have already passed critic-audit / critic-evidence, so include them into issues as-is.

```json
[{ "file": "...", "line": "...", "severity": "high", "summary": "..." }]
```

### Challenge pass on Codex findings (critic-audit, raw)

critic-audit raw output. Read verdict and severity per finding_id. See Phase 6 for stall handling.

```json
{
  "challenges": [
    {
      "finding_id": "F-042",
      "verdict": "confirmed",
      "original_severity": "high",
      "adjusted_severity": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Verification pass on Codex findings (critic-evidence, raw)

critic-evidence raw output. Read verdict, budget_exhausted, and evidence per finding_id.

```json
{
  "verifications": [
    {
      "finding_id": "F-042",
      "verdict": "verified",
      "budget_exhausted": false,
      "evidence": "type, detail with file:line references"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Promoted adversarial findings

Adversarial test failures that intent triage judged to be real bugs. Include them into issues as-is.

```json
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/file.rs",
    "line": 42,
    "severity": "high",
    "summary": "[adversarial] assertion text: failure detail",
    "source": "adversarial"
  }
]
```

### Dynamic evidence

Arrives as a single plain-text line. Example: `動的 evidence: build=pass, tests=pass (テストランナーからの補足)`.

## Phase 1: Parse input

Parse the input sections into structured findings. Even when a section is missing, assemble from the components that are available.

## Phase 2: Reconciliation

Match by finding_id and apply rules in order. After applying, process confirmed, downgraded, needs_context, and needs_review entries. Discard disputed. Challenger missing means verifier only, verifier missing means challenger only. If both are missing, skip reconciliation and feed the raw reviewer findings into Phase 3.

| Priority | Challenger | Verifier                                | Final verdict                                                         |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | disputed   | verified                                | needs_review (catches FN, Verifier found evidence)                    |
| 2        | any        | verified                                | confirmed (if downgraded, restore original severity)                  |
| 3        | any        | unverifiable                            | keep challenger verdict                                               |
| 4        | any        | weak_evidence + budget_exhausted        | keep challenger verdict, flag needs_context                           |
| 5        | any        | weak_evidence                           | keep challenger verdict                                               |
| 6        | (none)     | verified / weak_evidence / unverifiable | verified→confirmed, weak_evidence→needs_context, unverifiable→exclude |

## Phase 3: Merge

Merge the reconciled findings with the promoted adversarial findings into a single finding set.

## Phase 4: Cross-Evidence Correlation

Correlate static findings with dynamic evidence to reinforce or weaken support. Group correlated findings by location (file, module, boundary). Identify convergence signals where 2+ evidence types flag the same area. If no convergence cluster forms, treat every finding as standalone.

| Static Finding | Dynamic Evidence                  | Action                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| High severity  | Build/test fails at same location | Elevate to critical                   |
| High severity  | Adversarial test confirms         | Mark as strongly supported            |
| Any severity   | Build/test passes cleanly         | No change (passing does not disprove) |
| Weak evidence  | Adversarial test confirms         | Upgrade to verified                   |
| Any finding    | No dynamic evidence               | Keep as-is (static-only finding)      |

## Phase 5: Root Cause Synthesis

Reuses enhancer-integration synthesis logic.

1. Deduplicate by file:line:category, keeping the highest severity. When merged findings disagreed on severity, set `severity_upgraded: true` and record `original_severities: [{reviewer, severity}]`
2. Drop findings lacking a concrete trigger or file-read verification, keep the rest
3. Use the convergence clusters identified in Phase 4
4. Re-evaluate severity per convergence cluster (rules below)
5. Synthesize a root cause per convergence cluster and apply 5 Whys on the root cause, not individual findings
6. Apply 5 Whys individually to standalone findings
7. Classify the root cause: Architecture Gap / Knowledge Gap / Tooling Gap / Process Gap
8. Impact evaluation: findings_resolved × max_severity × fixability (used for root cause ordering, not Gate)

### Severity re-evaluation rules

- Cite the specific contributing finding that changes the impact assessment
- If no cross-domain context changes impact, record "Independent findings. No upgrade."
- Count alone does not justify an upgrade. Two mediums do not add up to a high

## Phase 6: Issue Finalization

This agent does not decide Gate. The calling script computes it deterministically from build/test results, issue count, and whether challenge stalled (skill phase-4 § Gate Rule). This agent only needs to finalize issues and root_causes.

| Rule                            | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Report every issue              | Include every confirmed issue in issues regardless of severity. Do not make a Gate-equivalent judgment            |
| Constraint violations count too | Include in issues regardless of origin (static / outcome / adversarial)                                           |
| Handling of challengeStalled    | Codex findings where both challenger and verifier stalled are excluded from issues and surfaced in report instead |

## Phase 7: Generate report

Assemble issues / root_causes into a human-readable report. Follow the format in Output § report.

## Constraints

Every root cause links to source findings.

## Output

Return `issues` / `root_causes` / `report` as structured output.

### issues

| Field    | Type          | Value                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| file     | string        | The file part of file:line                                                |
| line     | number        | The line part of file:line                                                |
| severity | enum          | critical / high / medium / low. A fix-priority hint, does not affect Gate |
| summary  | string        | The content of the issue and its basis                                    |
| source   | array<string> | Subset of audit / codex / adversarial                                     |

When there are no issues, and when all inputs are empty, return an empty array `[]` (a valid result, not an error).

### root_causes

One synthesized root cause per convergence cluster, one sentence each.

### report

A human-readable report string. With no outcome evidence, record Build/Tests as skipped; with no adversarial results, record Adversarial as skipped (static-only mode). When all inputs are empty, record "no evidence collected". Format below.

```markdown
