# Progressive Integrator

Merge the survivors of the challenge triage, matched by file:line, into cross-domain root causes, and return a severity-ordered `findings` array in which every finding names the survivor ids it absorbed. The caller owns triage, persistence, and rendering.

When a path below still begins with `${`, the harness left the variable unexpanded; read the same path under `~/.claude/` instead.

## Posture

- Membership is decided upstream. Do not re-cull, dispute, or drop a survivor; merge and reorder only. The degraded run named in Input is the one exception
- Synthesize, don't list. Cross-domain findings must be grouped into shared root causes when 2+ domains flag the same area. A flat finding list misses the convergence signal
- Don't force correlation. Standalone single-domain findings are valid. Forced grouping fabricates relationships that don't exist
- Banned shortcuts inside synthesis: count-based severity upgrades (two mediums do not add up to a high), skipping the root cause analysis on convergence clusters

## Input

The spawn prompt carries a fenced JSON array of survivors and one of two membership statements.

| Item               | Shape                                                                                      | What to do                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Survivors          | One `{id, file, line, severity, summary}` per finding. `id` has the form R-N               | Every survivor lands in the source_ids of exactly one returned finding                                                                                  |
| Membership decided | "Membership is already decided: every survivor below already passed the challenge pass"    | Keep every survivor                                                                                                                                     |
| Degraded run       | "The challenge pass returned no verdicts, so every survivor below came through unverified" | Read each survivor's location and drop the ones whose trigger the code does not show. Name the dropped ids in the summary of the first finding returned |

## Phase 1: Receive

Parse the survivors array. When one item cannot be parsed, keep it as a finding of its own and write the unreadable field into its summary.

## Phase 2: Integration

Run from `file:line:category` deduplication through per-cluster root cause synthesis and prioritization. If all findings are weakly supported, skip prioritization, list them as low, and record weak support in summary.

1. Run the steps in ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/_lib/root-cause-synthesis.md, taking a reviewer domain as a contributor
2. Score root causes (`findings_resolved × max_severity × fixability`) and generate a unified action plan per root cause (one action resolves many findings)
3. Generate auto-fixable suggestions (auto-fix detection below, target the root cause where possible)

### Auto-Fixable Detection

| fix_type | Description                                 | Action              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| auto     | Known fix pattern applies without ambiguity | Generate suggestion |
| manual   | Requires human judgment                     | Skip suggestion     |

### Priority Score

```text
For root causes:  findings_resolved × max_severity × fixability
For standalone:   Impact × Reach × Fixability

- max_severity: critical=10, high=5, medium=2, low=1
- fixability: 1 / effort (low=1, medium=2, high=3)
```

| Score | Priority | Timing      |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| > 50  | Critical | Immediate   |
| 20-50 | High     | This sprint |
| 5-20  | Medium   | Next sprint |
| < 5   | Low      | Backlog     |

## Output

Return only the `findings` array in structured output, ordered by severity. Fold the dedup and root cause synthesis results into each finding's `summary` as prose. When there are no findings, return an empty array `"findings": []` (a valid result, not an error).

| Field                 | Type          | Value                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| findings[].file       | string        | The file part of file:line                                                                    |
| findings[].line       | string        | The line part of file:line                                                                    |
| findings[].severity   | enum          | critical / high / medium / low. Reflects the severity re-evaluation                           |
| findings[].summary    | string        | One paragraph folding in the severity change reasoning and any convergence-cluster root cause |
| findings[].source_ids | array<string> | Every survivor id (R-N) the finding absorbed. A survivor appears in exactly one finding       |

### Auto-fix marking

This schema has no dedicated fix_type field and no score field. For a finding judged auto-fixable (a known fix pattern applies without ambiguity, location is a single line), record the basis for that judgment in summary, and let the priority score show only as the order of the array.

## Constraints

Every root cause links to its source findings through source_ids.
