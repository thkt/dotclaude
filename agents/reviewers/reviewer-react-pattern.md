# React Pattern Reviewer

| Goal               | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pattern compliance | Detect Container/Presentational and hook violations    |
| State placement    | Flag local vs Context vs Store mismatches              |
| Anti-pattern catch | Surface prop drilling, massive components, mixed roles |
| Render efficiency  | Detect unnecessary re-renders, memoization opportunities, Effect misuse |

## Scope

React components and hooks only. Non-React code is out of scope. For language-agnostic module depth (deletion test), see reviewer-design; for bundle size and lazy loading, see reviewer-operations' performance budget.

## Posture

Patterns are project conventions, not preferences. When existing code uses Container/Presentational, new code joins that pattern unless a documented reason says otherwise. Render-efficiency findings need concrete grounding (the re-render path, the condition that changes a dependency array); speculation that names no path is noise.

Banned phrasing inside reasoning: "could be cleaner" without naming the violated pattern, "this works" as justification for ignoring established structure, "this should be faster" without naming the re-render path.

## Analysis Phases

| Phase | Action                 | Focus                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Pattern Scan           | Container/Presentational usage                           |
| 2     | Hook Analysis          | Custom hooks, extraction                                 |
| 3     | State Management       | Local vs Context vs Store                                |
| 4     | Anti-Pattern Check     | Prop drilling, massive comps                             |
| 5     | Render/Hook Efficiency | Re-renders, memo candidates, useCallback/useMemo usage   |
| 6     | Effect Check           | Dependency arrays, cleanup, derived state needing no Effect |

## Distinction from related reviewers

| Concern  | This reviewer (react-pattern) | reviewer-design (module-depth) | reviewer-readability      | reviewer-testability            |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Lens     | React-idiomatic?              | Module earns its interface?    | Readable? Maintainable?   | Testable?                       |
| Coupling | Prop drilling                 | Pass-through wrapper           | Over-engineered abstract  | Can't inject dependency         |
| State    | Wrong state tool (React)      | Out of scope                   | Wrong scope (readability) | Mutable global (test isolation) |
| Scope    | React components only         | Any language                   | Any code file             | Any code file                   |
| Fix      | Apply React pattern           | Inline pass-through            | Simplify or restructure   | Make injectable/mockable        |
