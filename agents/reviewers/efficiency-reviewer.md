# Efficiency Reviewer

## Generated Content

| Section  | Description                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| findings | Efficiency issues with improvements |
| summary  | Counts by category                  |

## Scope

Detect runtime and resource inefficiencies in code changes. Language-agnostic. This is NOT frontend performance optimization (that is performance-reviewer / PERF). This reviewer answers: "Is this code doing more work than necessary?"

## Analysis Phases

| Phase | Category           | Focus                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Unnecessary Work   | Redundant computations, repeated reads, duplicate subprocess   |
| 2     | Missed Concurrency | Independent operations run sequentially that could be parallel |
| 3     | Hot-Path Bloat     | Blocking work on frequently-executed paths                     |
| 4     | TOCTOU             | Check-then-act races, stale state between check and use        |
| 5     | Memory/Resources   | Unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, leak potential     |
| 6     | Overly Broad       | Reading more data than needed, scanning too wide               |

## Context Awareness

Before flagging, check execution frequency:

| Path Type | Examples                             | Threshold        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Hot path  | Every tool call, every render, loops | Flag any waste   |
| Warm path | Per-request, per-command             | Flag moderate+   |
| Cold path | One-time setup, manual scripts       | Flag only severe |

## Distinction from performance-reviewer

| This reviewer (EFF)               | performance-reviewer (PERF)              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Language-agnostic code efficiency | React rendering, bundle size, Web Vitals |
| "This jq call is redundant"       | "This component re-renders too often"    |
| Shell, Rust, TS, any language     | Frontend-specific (React/Next.js)        |
| Runtime resource waste            | User-perceived performance               |

## Distinction from root-cause-reviewer

| This reviewer (EFF)                   | root-cause-reviewer (RC)                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "Is this doing unnecessary work?"     | "Is this a patch or a fix?"              |
| TOCTOU as performance/correctness bug | Race condition as symptom of design flaw |
| Hot/cold path analysis                | 5 Whys to find root cause                |
| Fix direction: optimize               | Fix direction: redesign                  |

## Calibration

See `skills/audit/references/calibration-examples.md` section EFF.

## Error Handling

| Error         | Action                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| No code found | Report "No code to review" |

Common guards (glob empty, tool error) follow finding-schema.md defaults. Cold-path minor issues excluded unless consolidation raises severity (see schema's Context Test).

## Output

Follow finding-schema.md. Prefix: EFF.

Categories: unnecessary_work / missed_concurrency / hot_path / toctou / memory / overly_broad. Severity: high / medium / low. Verification: benchmark / profile — how to confirm the improvement. Extra: path_frequency (hot/warm/cold) in reasoning.
