# Duplication Reviewer

## Generated Content

| Section  | Description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| findings | Duplication issues with extraction |
| summary  | Duplication counts by type         |

## Analysis Phases

| Phase | Action              | Focus                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Signature Scan      | Functions/blocks with similar signatures across files                     |
| 2     | Near-Duplicate Scan | Similar logic with different variable names                               |
| 3     | Pattern Extraction  | Repeated sequences (3+ lines) extractable to shared utility               |
| 4     | Reimplementation    | Same helper/logic independently implemented in multiple files             |
| 5     | Arg-Variant Scan    | Same function called with different arguments that could be parameterized |

## Detection Thresholds

| Type            | Threshold | Rationale                                        |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Exact duplicate | 2+        | Any exact duplication warrants extraction        |
| Near-duplicate  | 2+        | Similar logic with renamed vars, reordered lines |
| Pattern         | 3+ lines  | Shorter sequences are rarely worth extracting    |
| Arg-variant     | 2+ calls  | Same func/cmd with only args differing           |

This reviewer uses 2+ as the unified threshold. Rule of Three from
`rules/PRINCIPLES.md` (DRY) determines extraction urgency (severity), not
detection.

## Comparison Strategy

1. Read target files and extract function/block signatures and key patterns
2. Grep/Glob the broader codebase (same file types) for each extracted pattern —
   scan up to 100 files per file type (priority: same directory > imports >
   alphabetical)
3. Cross-compare signatures across target files AND codebase matches
4. For near-duplicates, normalize variable names before comparison. Similarity
   threshold: >=70% normalized token overlap
5. Report clusters (group of locations sharing the same pattern)
6. If Phase 1-2 yield zero matches above similarity threshold, skip Phase 3-5

## Distinction from reuse-reviewer

| This reviewer (duplication)            | reuse-reviewer                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Code vs code (any direction)           | New code vs existing utilities     |
| "Extract shared Y from A and B"        | "Use the existing X instead"       |
| Cross-compares all target files        | Searches outward from changed code |
| Actionable: extract new shared utility | Actionable: replace with import    |

## Calibration

See `templates/audit/calibration-examples.md` section DRY.

## Error Handling

| Error         | Action                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| No code found | Report "No code to review" |

Common guards (glob empty, tool error) follow finding-schema.md defaults.

## Output

Follow finding-schema.md. Prefix: DRY.

Categories: exact / near-duplicate / pattern / reimplementation / arg-variant.
Severity: high / medium / low.
Verification: pattern_search — are there more occurrences beyond the ones found?
Extra: Evidence lists each occurrence as `Location N: fileN:line snippet`.
