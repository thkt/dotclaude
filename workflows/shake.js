    "Deterministic flaky-test detection workflow. Shakes the target tests 10 times per each of 4 dimensions (repeat / order / parallelism / seed) with a static smell scan running alongside, and classifies each target as confirmed-flaky / latent-flaky / stable. The script enforces the run counts and the classification rule, so thinned-out runs and lenient stable verdicts cannot happen. confirmed-flaky targets get a root-cause fix verified by re-shake.",

    "When tests fail intermittently, CI goes red at random, or you want to surface latent flakiness in green tests.

// Three design points.
// 1. "≥10 runs per dimension" is enforced twice: by schema (runs minItems) and by script
//    recount. Left to the LLM, the count could be thinned via self-report; in the
//    workflow, a dimension without 10 individual run records counts as unshaken and is
//    structurally shut out of a stable verdict (fail-close).
// 2. Classification (confirmed-flaky / latent-flaky / stable) is computed by script rule
//    from run records and smell hits, not reported by an agent.
// 3. The 4 dimensions + smell scan run in parallel per target, and targets flow
//    independently through a pipeline (the slowest target does not block the rest).
//
// An inconclusive verdict. When a shake agent stalls
// or records fewer than 10 runs, the dimension becomes unshaken, and inconclusive is the
// catch basin that keeps such targets from claiming stable.
// The run-number placeholder in commands is {RUN} (angle brackets are avoided because
// guardrails raw-html misreads them as HTML tags).
