// gate.py's: no tracked file outside docs/decisions/ and .claude/workspace/research/ (kept as
// historical record, per docs/wiki/retire-rename-procedure.md) still names a retired path. The
// walk and the historical-directory exclusions are offendersAmong (workflows/_lib/tests/_retirement.ts),
// shared with gate-retirement.test.ts and record-retirement.test.ts; this file keeps only the
// tracked-files caching and the positive-control glue that are specific to it.
