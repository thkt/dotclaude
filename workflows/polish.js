    "Deterministic Codex review + cleanup. Codex findings always pass through a critic-audit challenge, and the triage (confirmed / disputed / downgraded / needs_context) is decided by the script, so findings are never aggregated as facts and the challenge cannot be skipped. After the fix, critic-audit rejudges each survivor against the post-fix diff as resolved / still_open, and still_open surfaces as reopened in the result. Callable standalone; no workflow nests it.",

    "Headless external-lens review of a diff plus AI-slop removal. Pass a scope string, or an object carrying scope, repo, mode, and base. When scope is omitted, the target is the uncommitted changes, else the diff of commits ahead of the base branch (default main) — the pushed branch diff. mode (full / review / cleanup): full (default) runs review -> fix -> rejudge -> cleanup; review returns the challenged findings without fixing; cleanup runs only simplify + enhancer-code + test validation.
