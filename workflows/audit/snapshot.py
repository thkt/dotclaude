"""Usage: snapshot.py   (audit payload JSON on stdin)

Deterministically record one audit run to $HOME/.claude/workspace/history/ and
compute the resolved/new/carried delta against the most recent prior snapshot.
audit.js used to hand this to a general-purpose LLM agent, which walked the file
glob and the finding-by-finding diff token by token and took minutes serially at
the tail of the run. The work is pure bookkeeping (glob, match on file+message,
count, write JSON), so moving it here turns a multi-minute agent into a single
sub-second shell call and makes the delta rule tested code, not prompt adherence.

The workflow script itself cannot touch the filesystem or read env, so the caller
still spawns a shell agent -- but that agent's whole job is now `snapshot.py <
payload`, not reasoning about the diff.

stdin:  JSON {scope, focus, pre_flight, raw_findings[], findings[], skipped[]}
        each raw_findings entry carries at least {file, message}.
stdout: the path of the JSON record written.
exit 0 on success. exit 1 on an unparseable payload (nothing written).

Resolved fields (shell / prior snapshot), added to the record:
  branch        git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD (falls back to "unknown")
  generated_at  UTC ISO-8601
  delta         {resolved, new, carried} counts vs the most recent prior
                audit-*.json, matched on (file, message); first run -> all 0 with
                note "first run".
