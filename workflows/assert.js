// 1. The static reviewer fan-out is the nested workflow("audit"), so its routing table is not
//    duplicated. Its findings already passed critic-audit / critic-evidence there, so assert's
//    Challenge applies to Codex findings only.
// 2. The gate is computed by schema + script rule from (build, tests, issues), never decoded
//    from the enhancer's prose.
// 3. worktree.ts / bootstrap.ts are deterministic; setup and cleanup derive the same branch /
//    path from $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID.
// 4. adversarial (codex 600s) starts with Evidence and runs behind Challenge / Triage; in a
//    barrier the longest stage would block everything.
// When OUTCOME.md is absent, no stub is generated: assert has no write side-effects on the
// target repo. The absence goes in the report.
