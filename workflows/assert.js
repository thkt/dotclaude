    "Deterministic, independent outcome-based assertion workflow.

  whenToUse:
    "When you want an independent verdict on merge readiness from static + dynamic evidence. Use the polish workflow for a light code review, the audit workflow for static-only auditing. args is a scope string (file / directory for target mode) or {scope, base, repo}. Omitted: diff mode (uncommitted changes, else diff against the base branch).",

// Four design points.
// 1. The static reviewer fan-out reuses the nested workflow("audit") instead of duplicating
//    the routing table (so a routing-table change propagates to assert directly). Audit
//    findings already passed critic-audit / critic-evidence inside audit, so assert's Challenge
//    applies only to Codex findings, avoiding a double challenge by the same agents.
// 2. The gate is computed by schema + script rule. Instead of decoding the gate from the
//    enhancer's prose, the script computes it by rule from (build, tests, issues), so the
//    re-spawn / fail-close machinery itself becomes unneeded.
// 3. worktree.py / bootstrap.py are deterministic scripts, so agents run them as-is.
//    The session id resolves via the agent environment's $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID, so setup and
//    cleanup derive the same branch / path from the same id and never drift.
// 4. adversarial (codex 600s) starts with Evidence and runs behind Challenge / Triage
//    (putting it in a barrier would let the longest stage block everything).
//
// When OUTCOME.md is absent, do NOT generate a stub via /outcome. assert is verification and
// has no write side-effects on the target repo. Record the absence in the report and move on.
