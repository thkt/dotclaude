"""Usage: bootstrap.py <worktree-path>

Detect the project type inside <worktree-path>, install dependencies, and run a
build smoke test. Per-step timeouts (install 180s, build 600s) are enforced via
subprocess so the result holds on platforms without timeout(1) (e.g. macOS).

stdout: JSON {project_type, install, build, install_cmd, build_cmd, reason}
  install: ok | fail | skip   (skip = project type has no dependency step)
  build:   pass | fail | skipped
exit 0 on a completed run (read the verdict from JSON); exit 1 on usage / path error.

Gate routing (caller, references/phase-4.md § Bootstrap Failure Handling). The
trichotomy is encoded by (install, build) jointly, not by build alone:

  install=fail  + build=skipped  -> env failure         -> Ready (caveat) path
  install=ok    + build=fail     -> build smoke broken  -> NotReady
  install=ok/skip + build=skipped -> no build concept          -> proceed normally
  install=ok/skip + build=pass    -> clean                     -> proceed normally

A build timeout that fires after the build started is reported as build=fail: a
hanging build is indistinguishable from a broken one, and treating it as
environmental would let it reach Ready (caveat) (references/phase-0.md 0b).
