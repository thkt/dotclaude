## Conflict Resolution

- Outcome-driven defines the why, Backcasting the goal, and the other principles the path.
- Systems Thinking sets the scope to optimize (the whole system that carries the outcome), and Occam's Razor picks the simplest approach within that scope.
- When in doubt, simple > clever, concrete > abstract, working > perfect, readable > DRY.
- Occam's Razor does not count temporary symptom relief as an achievement, and picks only the simplest approach that does not degrade the output quality directly tied to outcome achievement.
