# Workflow Conventions

Conventions for workflow scripts (headless deterministic pipelines) under `.claude/workflows/`.

## Degradation recording

Degradation is a branch that drops or defaults a failed or missing sub-result without recording it at loss granularity in either a structured field or `log()`. Loss granularity is the information that lets a reader reconstruct what / how many / why was lost (count, id, target name, reason).

The primary channel is the workflow return value and snapshot. `log()` is a conversational supplement that surfaces on the run log a degradation the return value alone would hide from a human. When the loss granularity already lives in a structured return field, `log()` is optional.

The granularity to record per situation is below.

| Situation                                                    | Granularity to record                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent response fails the schema and falls to a default       | Dropped count, target ids, that a default was taken |
| Part of the sub-result is missing and the rest continues     | Fetched count out of the total, ids of the missing  |
| A failure is swallowed and fail-open advances the next phase | What could not be verified, that it is unverified   |

## Calibration

Contrast `build.js` translate-tail as the good case against a silent empty-array default as the bad case.

| Verdict | Branch                                                                          | Recording                                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Good    | Not every id is present, fail-open to the English originals                     | Emits `${byId.size}/${slots.length} translated` to `log()`       |
| Bad     | Falls an agent response to an empty-array default and continues without a count | Neither count nor reason survives in the return value or `log()` |

## Already-recorded sites

Sites that already keep loss granularity in a structured field (a return array or count) are out of scope. Duplicating the same information into `log()` is not required.

## Test coverage

Each current degradation site is guarded by its own site-specific test. No cross-cutting test guarantees the whole degradation class (that every branch keeps loss granularity). When adding a new drop / default branch, verify the loss-granularity recording in that site's own test. Existing tests do not automatically guard a new site.
