# Subagent Conventions

Conventions for subagent files under `agents/`.

## Naming

The only naming pattern is lowercase + hyphens, `<role>-<scope>`. Files live in the plural-role subdirectory.

| Role prefix | Purpose                      | Example           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| critic-     | Challenge                    | critic-design     |
| enhancer-   | Code improvement + synthesis | enhancer-code     |
| explorer-   | Codebase exploration         | explorer-feature  |
| generator-  | Artifact generation          | generator-test    |
| resolver-   | Error resolution             | resolver-build    |
| reviewer-   | Inspection                   | reviewer-security |

## YAML Frontmatter

Subagents are spawned via the Agent tool, not auto-loaded. AskUserQuestion / EnterPlanMode / ScheduleWakeup and similar tools do not work inside subagents, even when listed in `tools`. The Agent tool itself does work inside a subagent, and subagents nest up to depth 3 counting the main loop as depth 0.

| background                      | Boolean. An interactive-session spawn runs in the background even when this is set to `false`. Workflow and headless paths fall outside that default                           |
| omitClaudeMd                    | Boolean. Spawns without the user, project, and local CLAUDE.md files and rules/. Set it on agents that take every judgment target from the delegation prompt.

| observer                        | Agent type auto-spawned as a background observer whenever this agent runs. The observer takes read-only activity digests, reports via ObserverReport, and never joins the task |
| observerMessage                 | Supplemental postamble appended to each activity digest sent to the observer. Blank values are ignored                                                                         |

## Fork decision

`subagent_type` takes exactly one value. `"fork"` and an `agents/` type name are mutually exclusive, so choosing fork loads no agent definition. A fork is a copy of yourself, not a different agent. critic- and reviewer- agents exist to attack the parent's conclusion, so forking one dissolves the role.

| Spawn                                    | Fork | Reason                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Names an `agents/` type                  | No   | The model choice, tool limits, independence, and return shape all disappear at once                                                 |
| Omits the type or passes a built-in type | Yes  | When the parent conversation is the subject itself, it saves copying context into the prompt. Input tokens grow by the conversation |

## Choosing model and memory

Grant memory when all three below hold, and remove it when the project scope stays empty of real data afterward.

- Spawned repeatedly across sessions (called on every audit)
- Output quality depends on project-specific knowledge (naming conventions, allowed patterns)
- It reduces false positives or improves consistency (stops re-reporting known exceptions)

| What the model needs                                          | Recommended  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Multi-step instructions, agent-to-agent DM, shutdown protocol | opus, sonnet |
| Mechanical single-pass output                                 | haiku        |
| Matching the parent context                                   | inherit      |

## Body structure

| Section                | Purpose                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Input                  | The task prompt the agent expects |
| Constraints / PROHIBIT | What the agent must not do        |
| Workflow / Phases      | Step-by-step actions              |
| Output                 | DM payload or file artifact       |
| Error Handling         | Recovery behavior                 |

## Finding severity

reviewer- agents follow the Severity (critical / high / medium / low) in `agents/_lib/finding-schema.md`. What to fix first is the Disposition in `agents/_lib/finding-disposition.md`, which is where the values are listed. An agent returning its own gate verdict (critic- agents with confirmed / disputed) follows its own scheme.

## Detection item inclusion

Give a reviewer a detection item when a reader skimming the output would miss what it catches. Leave it out when the reader arrives at the same problem without it.

This decides which items the reviewer carries, once per item, while its definition is written. `agents/_lib/finding-disposition.md` § Calibration Filters decides which of the findings a run produced get reported, once per finding, while the reviewer runs.

## Reference notation

Where a relative path resolves depends on the launching project. An agent body has no variable that expands in both the dev tree and a plugin install: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is skill-only, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expands under a plugin install alone and stays literal in the dev tree. So a bundled asset takes the plugin form plus one fallback sentence, placed right after the intro paragraph, worded exactly as below. `tests/live-instructions.test.js` checks both the sentence and the absence of a bare home-anchored path.

> When a path below still begins with `${`, the harness left the variable unexpanded; read the same path under `~/.claude/` instead.

| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/_lib/foo.md` bare                               | Lazy-loading a bundled asset | Expands under a plugin install. The fallback sentence sends the dev tree to `~/.claude/` |
| `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/cache/<file>`, `$HOME/.claude/history/` | A file on the running side   | Not a distributed asset, so the same path holds under a plugin too                       |
| `~/.claude/agents/_lib/foo.md` alone                                          | Never                        | Names the dev tree. A plugin install reads another copy, or none                         |
| `skills/<skill>/references/foo.md`                                            | Avoid                        | Resolves only when cwd is `~/.claude`                                                    |
| `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`                                                         | Not available                | Skill-body-only variable                                                                 |

## Size limit

- An agent body and a shared fragment under `_lib/` both cap at 100 lines
- Over the cap, an agent body moves detail into `_lib/` and a `_lib/` file splits by topic
