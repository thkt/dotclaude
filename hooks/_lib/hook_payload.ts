// Typed reads of a hook payload, and the one write a PreToolUse hook makes. The TypeScript
// side of hooks/_lib/hook_payload.py; both stay in the tree while the consumers move over one
// at a time, and hooks/_lib/tests/hook-payload-parity.test.ts holds the two to the same answers.
//
// JSON.parse returns `any`, and a `typeof x === "object"` check narrows only to `object`, so a
// field read straight from the payload spreads that looseness through every caller a type
// checker follows. This module is the one place that admits it. Values leave here as
// `unknown`, which a caller has to narrow before using -- the same contract hook_payload.py's
// docstring states for `object`.
