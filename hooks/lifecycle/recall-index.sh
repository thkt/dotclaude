# SessionStart hook: catch up recall's cross-session index in the background.
#
# Why SessionStart (not SessionEnd):
#   - the previous session's transcript is already flushed to disk, so it gets picked up
#   - SessionStart always fires (SessionEnd can be missed on hard kill); misses self-heal
#   - `recall index` EMBEDS new sessions (measured ~6s typical, ~26s on backlog; the cost is
#     IO/network-bound, not CPU). A multi-second job detached at SessionEnd risks being reaped
#     mid-embed as the session tears down; at start the session stays alive, so it completes.
#
# Throttled: because it embeds, `recall index` is not free. Skip if it ran recently, so a burst
# of session starts costs a single stat and a real catch-up runs at most once per window.
#
# Fail-open (advisory): never block the prompt.

# Skip compaction restarts: no newly completed sessions, and the live transcript is mid-write

# Throttle: skip if indexed within the last WINDOW_MIN minutes (timestamp shared across sessions).
# WINDOW_MIN is effectively the worst-case staleness: a session completed just after a run waits
# up to this long to become searchable. recall serves days-old "past decisions", so hours are fine;
# the bound exists mainly to kill session-start churn (this harness starts dozens of sessions/day).
